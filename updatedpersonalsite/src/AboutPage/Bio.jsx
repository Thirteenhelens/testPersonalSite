        Good question! As a lifelong gamer, I have a vested interest in
        technology. Not just overall, but all of the intricacies behind how
        things work. As I grew up, my intrigue increased and I started looking
        into how all of my favorite technologies seemed to magically work.
        Learning that real human people were behind all of this was a
        life-changing revelation because to me, it meant that if I talked to the
        computer in its own language it could perform this magic for me! From
        there, I started tinkering and building whatever I could get my hands on
        from my personal PC, to my mechanical keyboard. Beyond my technical
        fascination, the logical nature of computers motivated me to try and add
        personality and life to whatever I made.
